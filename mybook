Chapter I
It was the middle of the night. I woke up and find myself sweating

Chapter II
I started shivering and feeling very uneasy, my breath was not in control

I drink a glass of water walk a bit and eat some food. I feel better

I try to recollect why I was sweating and my memory retraced my dream where I was in a dark area alone and heard the roar of lion

ChapterIII

Now I thought why this dream came in my mind? Was I affected by my recent experience and I realize that i watched a movie with a scene of lion eating a human and that was the reason I saw that dream

Here changes are different than what i did in other branch
